Current development progress

- `resports-aws-cdk` is currently in a completed state, but the NAT instance is shut down to save costs. This does NOT require any further development at this point
- `resports-client` is currently configured to either send requests to the AWS or cyclic API endpoint with no changes other that that of the "API_ENDPOINT" environment variable
- `resports-server` is currently in a completed state with working cyclic deployment.
